# Pelican-crossing
Controller for pedestrian crossing



Pelican crossing is a form of organizing pedestrian crossing in main streets and roads. The main purpose is to ensure a safe crossing for pedestrian and change traffic light accordingly. Pelican crossing uses traffic light poles to indicate when a pedestrian can cross safety. Some Pelican light poles contain a push button to activate and indicate the presence of pedestrian that wish to cross the street. The push button informs the traffic light control unit to change accordingly. The Pelican light pole usually contain two symbols, a red stop hand and a green walking person.
